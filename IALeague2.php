who attended the lessons to have a pro woman help out! Juliana would start out each Thursday with a half-hour lesson on technique. Each week she focused on something different such as: driving, putting, approach shots, UD shots and how to throw when you're behind a tree or in the trees. We'd then break up into groups again and one experienced player would go with the new players.
</p>
<p>    The last three years, Barb Thacker and I have been giving the lessons. We shortened the lessons to six weeks only, for two hours once a week. The first two weeks we concentrate on approach shots, the next two weeks we practice putting, and the last two weeks everyone learns how to drive.</p>

<p>PRIZES<br/>
    Kris received donations of discs and shirts from The Des Moines Disc Golf Club, Lance Coles, Brian Malone, and The Disc Golf Journal. She gave these out to the new players after attending three or more times. She also had putting and driving contests where only the new players could participate. Barb</div>

     <p>  and I have donated discs to the new women players, after they have been to the lessons for a few weeks.</p>

<p>WHAT WE LEARNED <br/>
    Make sure when you start your women's lessons, that you have them at one of your smaller courses. It's best to have the lessons at the same course and at the same time each week. We also gave a handout to each woman the first night they show up, explaining what disc golf is all about.</p>

<p>    Continue to be as positive as possible. After the first year of lessons, we had three women players who started attending the mixed league and participating in tournaments.</p>
