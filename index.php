      <p>The origins of this site date back to 1993 when I was a grad student in computer science and a new disc golfer. I had just learned about HTML and wanted to put some information online. My immediate thought was to put up a disc golf site. It was actually rather difficult to figure out what such a site might consist of. </p>
      <p>Initially I had information regarding the Hall of Fame.  Eventually I had a few fan pages from some of the top golfers.  Then as I became a little more knowledgeable   about the sport I included some educational information such as types of grips.  Then around 1996 I created a calendar of events.  I feel that that was the most valuable information   as the PDGA website was not yet in existence.  I also created a section for women in the sport where the primary goal was to help travelling players find inexpensive or free accommodations   with other female disc golfers.</p>
<p>Around 2006, my site pretty much disappeared.  Now in September of 2008, I finally have the energy and desire to bring it back. </p>

      <p>I'm not sure how much of the old sites will be incorporated into this one, but I hope to once again create a valuable disc golf resource.</p>
      <p>Currently the only link in the above header that has anything interesting attached to it is under the header "Women".  It is <a href="roseold/index.html">La Vie en Rose</a> which is a women's only A tier event that will be held February 14 &amp; 15, 2009.  Please visit the site and pass the word onto any female disc golfers you know.</p>
