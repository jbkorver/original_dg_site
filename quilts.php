       <p>In 1995 at the Am World Championships in Cincinnati, OH, I received an incredibly cool T-shirt. I loved the design on the shirt, but never wore it. So I decided to figure out a way to preserve and even display this shirt as well as others that I had accumulated from tournament play. </p>
       <p>That was the beginning of my version of the T-shirt quilt. Now I am certainly not the first to think of such an idea. This concept has been around for decades. But I do believe I put a different spin on the project. </p>
       <p>Instead of using a grid system where all the shirts are cut to the same size and then framed with other material, I use only T-shirt material and most importantly, I create a collage. The quilt top becomes a puzzle that I have to fit together. The number of shirts and the size of the designs dictate the end size of the quilt. No two quilts are even close to being the same.</p>

      <div class="main_mid">
        <p>Over the years, I have created about 25 of these practical quilts. I love to put them together, but even more than that, I love to see the reaction of the person I have created it for when they see it for the first time.</p>
        <p>This is not a quick process and it is not cheap, but if you would like me to help you preserve your memories with a T-shirt quilt, I would love to talk to you about it. You can contact me for pricing and timeframe at <script language=javascript>
