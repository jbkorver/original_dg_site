      <p> Here is an idea to try to get more women to play in a disc golf tournament.</p>

<p>    How about a nonsanctioned event focused on trying to get women involved in which you encourage all the guys to find as many women as they can to play in the event. How can you do that? Well, find some big prizes that the guys really want then give them one mulligan for each women they get to play in the tournament. Maybe they get two mulligans for a women who has never played in league or a tournament before. If the prize is desirable enough, hopefully the guys will work hard at getting all their female friends out to the course.</p>
<p>
 At this event, I would let the women play for a very small fee. Make sure each one of them gets a disc and make them feel welcomed! Praise their abilities (even if they are only throwing 50 feet). Tell them how quickly an individual can improve in this sport. It would be ideal if you could have a few women that have played for a while their to give a quick intro to the new women so they are not as intimidated. </p>

      <div class="main_mid">
      <p>When everyone starts playing, make sure the groups are such that men are not waiting for the new women to play. This would further intimidate the women and if they feel rushed or watched, they may not enjoy it. In fact, maybe you should send the men out and have a smaller temp course set up were the women can play a few rounds. So this could be billed as a women's workshop. Maybe they don't even participate in the actual tournament, but you introduce them to it in a way that they want to come back and try it again. </p>
      <p>(For the record, I am NOT suggesting that women should play shorter or easier courses, but if the women are new to the sport, you do not want to scare them away. If I ever had the feeling of better players waiting on me or laughing at me when I had started, I would not have continued. Instead I heard nothing but praise - even though I now know just how bad I was to begin with. )</p>
